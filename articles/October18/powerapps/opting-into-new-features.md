[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

App makers can choose to opt into new features in their current apps when they are ready. New features are available for a limited time before the features are auto-enabled in all apps. This allows app makers to try out the features in existing apps and make any changes needed before they are rolled out globally. New apps created will take advantage of any new feature available.
