製品の機能が簡単に見つかることは、すべてのユーザーにとって非常に重要なことです。 製品の内容の概要を把握することも同様です。 2019 年 4 月の更新では、ロール センターの内容に基づいて製品の機能の概要をすべて提供することで、機能を見つけやすくなっています。 これにより、お客様は製品の適切な機能のナビゲートと発見がずっと容易になり、ロール センターの概要とその内容も提供されます。 現在のロール センター ナビゲーション バー、コマンド バー、または操作アシスト検索を使用するための補足として、この新しい概要では、必要なアクションやモジュールが提供されており、お客様は集中して生産的な状態を維持できます。 

<!--
Describe the new feature, and then give an elevator pitch of the business value for it. Include high-value capabilities that light up something exciting for our customers. The feature should be something that a customer needs to plan for...definitely larger than a hotfix or bug fix.

If the feature has been designated as a key feature, complete the entire template. Otherwise, only complete the **Business value**, **Describe the feature**, and **Status** sections.

## Business value (Required)
Describe the top capabilities of the feature and and the business problems it solves.  

**Example**
End-of-day processing is a crucial element of retail operational workflow. This involves aggregation of raw transactions into meaningful business data to ensure that business and accounting rules are conformed to, before posting transactions as official business records. Improving the reliability and performance of this batch process and increasing the visibility of the processing for the administrator improves the user experience. Users can easily monitor the progress of the processing and see exactly what caused a validation failure. As a result, they can quickly resolve the issue and reliably retry the process without contacting Microsoft Support. 

## Describe the feature (Required)
Describe how the feature works and the scenarios the feature enables. Include concrete examples and screenshots. 

**Example**
New capabilities include improved statement posting performance by removing table deadlocks and optimizing batch processing. The introduction of a state model in the posting process aids in rollback and recovery, which eliminates data corruption and the need for manual intervention. Enhanced in-app diagnostics with detailed status, errors, and logs (including details of transactions included in the scope of the statement, transactions resulting in errors, and possible steps to correct issues) allow for easy troubleshooting.

### Who uses this feature (Required)

**Example**

### License required
List the license(s) a customer must have to use the feature. 

### Setup required (if any beyond standard product setup)

**Example**
This feature must be enabled in System parameters by an administrator. 

### Quick steps (provide if feature is done enough)

**Example**
To get started with model‑driven apps, use designers to:
- Define your site map. Model your app's navigation, pulling in only the subset of information your users need. Take advantage of multiple levels of hierarchy and the ability to reference external resources.
- Add dashboards. Include model‑driven dashboards or embedded Power BI content within your app.
- Include entities and components. Add specific forms, views, dashboards, and charts for targeted entities to craft your user experience.
